# 04-Bulk move worklogs [POST]

`POST /rest/api/3/issue/{issueIdOrKey}/worklog/move`

Moves a list of worklogs from one issue to another. This is an experimental API with several limitations:

 *  You can't move more than 5000 worklogs at once.
 *  You can't move worklogs containing an attachment.
 *  You can't move worklogs restricted by project roles.
 *  No notifications will be sent for moved worklogs.
 *  No webhooks or events will be sent for moved worklogs.
 *  No issue history will be recorded for moved worklogs.

Time tracking must be enabled in Jira, otherwise this operation returns an error. For more information, see [Configuring time tracking](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/qoXKM).

**[Permissions](#permissions) required:**

 *  *Browse projects* [project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for the projects containing the source and destination issues.
 *  If [issue-level security](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/J4lKLg) is configured, issue-level security permission to view the issue.
 *  *Delete all worklogs* [project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg)
 *  *Work on issues* [project permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) to log work on an issue, that is to create a worklog entry, if time tracking is enabled. This permission is required as a prerequisite for applying the other time-tracking permissions
 *  If the worklog has visibility restrictions, belongs to the group or has the role visibility is restricted to.
