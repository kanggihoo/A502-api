# 14-Edit issue [PUT]

`PUT /rest/api/3/issue/{issueIdOrKey}`

Edits an issue. Issue properties may be updated as part of the edit. Please note that issue transition is not supported and is ignored here. To transition an issue, please use [Transition issue](#api-rest-api-3-issue-issueIdOrKey-transitions-post).

The edits to the issue's fields are defined using `update` and `fields`. The fields that can be edited are determined using [ Get edit issue metadata](#api-rest-api-3-issue-issueIdOrKey-editmeta-get).

**Note:** This endpoint doesn't check screen configurations to determine if a field is editable. For more context, see the [Deprecation of override screen security](https://community.developer.atlassian.com/t/deprecation-of-override-screen-security/97153) announcement.

The parent field may be set by key or ID. For standard issue types, the parent may be removed by setting `update.parent.set.none` to *true*. Note that the `description`, `environment`, and any `textarea` type custom fields (multi-line text fields) take Atlassian Document Format content. Single line custom fields (`textfield`) accept a string and don't handle Atlassian Document Format content.
