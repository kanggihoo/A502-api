# 03-Get bulk permissions [POST]

`POST /rest/api/3/permissions/check`

Returns:

 *  for a list of global permissions, the global permissions granted to a user.
 *  for a list of project permissions and lists of projects and issues, for each project permission a list of the projects and issues a user can access or manipulate.

If no account ID is provided, the operation returns details for the logged in user.

Note that:

 *  Invalid project and issue IDs are ignored.
 *  A maximum of 1000 projects and 1000 issues can be checked.
 *  Null values in `globalPermissions`, `projectPermissions`, `projectPermissions.projects`, and `projectPermissions.issues` are ignored.
 *  Empty strings in `projectPermissions.permissions` are ignored.

**Deprecation notice:** The required OAuth 2.0 scopes will be updated on June 15, 2024.

 *  **Classic**: `read:jira-work`
 *  **Granular**: `read:permission:jira`

This operation can be accessed anonymously.

**[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Administer Jira* [global permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/x4dKLg) to check the permissions for other users, otherwise none. However, Connect apps can make a call from the app server to the product to obtain permission details for any user, without admin permission. This Connect app ability doesn't apply to calls made using AP.request() in a browser.
