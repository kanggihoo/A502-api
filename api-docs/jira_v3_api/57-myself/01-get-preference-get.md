# 01-Get preference [GET]

`GET /rest/api/3/mypreferences`

Returns the value of a preference of the current user.

Note that these keys are deprecated:

 *  *jira.user.locale* The locale of the user. By default this is not set and the user takes the locale of the instance.
 *  *jira.user.timezone* The time zone of the user. By default this is not set and the user takes the timezone of the instance.

These system preferences keys will be deprecated by 15/07/2024. You can still retrieve these keys, but it will not have any impact on Notification behaviour.

 *  *user.notifications.watcher* Whether the user gets notified when they are watcher.
 *  *user.notifications.assignee* Whether the user gets notified when they are assignee.
 *  *user.notifications.reporter* Whether the user gets notified when they are reporter.
