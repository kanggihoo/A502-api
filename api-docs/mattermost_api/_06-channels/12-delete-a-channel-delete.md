# 12-Delete a channel [DELETE]

`DELETE /api/v4/channels/{channel_id}`

Archives a channel. This will set the `deleteAt` to the current timestamp in the database. Soft deleted channels may not be accessible in the user interface. They can be viewed and unarchived in the **System Console > User Management > Channels** based on your license. Direct and group message channels cannot be deleted.

As of server version 5.28, optionally use the `permanent=true` query parameter to permanently delete the channel for compliance reasons. To use this feature `ServiceSettings.EnableAPIChannelDeletion` must be set to `true` in the server's configuration. If you permanently delete a channel this action is not recoverable outside of a database backup.

##### Permissions
`delete_public_channel` permission if the channel is public,
`delete_private_channel` permission if the channel is private,
or have `manage_system` permission.
