Get up and running in under two minutes. All you need is a Notion account and a terminal.

## Step 1: Get a personal access token

A personal access token (PAT) lets you authenticate API requests as yourself. No connection setup or OAuth flow required.

**Don’t see the option to create a token?**

On Business and Enterprise plans, PAT creation is restricted by default. Ask a workspace owner to enable it in **Settings & members → Connections**.

[Learn more about who can create PATs →](https://developers.notion.com/guides/get-started/personal-access-tokens#who-can-create-pats)

Set the token as an environment variable so you can use it in the examples below. This lasts for your current terminal session — run it again if you open a new window.

```shellscript
export NOTION_API_KEY=ntn_***
```

```powershell
$env:NOTION_API_KEY = "ntn_***"
```

## Step 2: Create a page

Make a POST request to the [Create a page](https://developers.notion.com/reference/post-page) endpoint with markdown content. The API creates a private page in your workspace, using the `# heading` as the page title automatically.

```shellscript
curl -X POST https://api.notion.com/v1/pages \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NOTION_API_KEY" \
  -H "Notion-Version: 2026-03-11" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "icon": { "emoji": "🚀" },
    "markdown": "# Hello from the API\n\n## Welcome\n\nThis page was created with the Notion API. You just made your first request!\n\n- Read the [API reference](https://developers.notion.com/reference/intro)\n- Explore [examples](https://developers.notion.com/page/examples)"
  }'
```

```http
POST https://api.notion.com/v1/pages
Authorization: Bearer {PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN}
Content-Type: application/json
Notion-Version: 2026-03-11

{
  "icon": { "emoji": "🚀" },
  "markdown": "# Hello from the API\n\n## Welcome\n\nThis page was created with the Notion API. You just made your first request!\n\n- Read the [API reference](https://developers.notion.com/reference/intro)\n- Explore [examples](https://developers.notion.com/page/examples)"
}
```

```javascript
// npm install @notionhq/client
const { Client } = require("@notionhq/client");

const notion = new Client({ auth: process.env.NOTION_API_KEY });

async function main() {
  const page = await notion.pages.create({
    icon: { emoji: "🚀" },
    markdown: [
      "# Hello from the API",
      "",
      "## Welcome",
      "",
      "This page was created with the Notion API. You just made your first request!",
      "",
      "- Read the [API reference](https://developers.notion.com/reference/intro)",
      "- Explore [examples](https://developers.notion.com/page/examples)",
    ].join("\n"),
  });

  console.log("Created page:", page.url);
}

main();
```

The `markdown` field accepts [Notion-flavored Markdown](https://developers.notion.com/guides/data-apis/enhanced-markdown) — headings, lists, code blocks, links, and more. The API converts it to Notion blocks for you.

Under the hood: markdown → blocks

Notion pages are made up of **blocks** — headings, paragraphs, lists, and more. When you send `markdown`, the API converts it into this block structure automatically.

You can also build this structure directly using the `children` field. Here’s what the same page looks like expressed as blocks:

```json
{
  "icon": { "emoji": "🚀" },
  "properties": {
    "title": [{ "text": { "content": "Hello from the API" } }]
  },
  "children": [
    {
      "object": "block",
      "type": "heading_2",
      "heading_2": {
        "rich_text": [{ "text": { "content": "Welcome" } }]
      }
    },
    {
      "object": "block",
      "type": "paragraph",
      "paragraph": {
        "rich_text": [
          {
            "text": {
              "content": "This page was created with the Notion API. You just made your first request!"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The block model gives you precise control over every element — formatting, colors, toggles, and block types that markdown can’t express. Use `markdown` when you want simplicity, and `children` when you need that control.

See [Working with page content](https://developers.notion.com/guides/data-apis/working-with-page-content) to learn more about the block model.

## Check the result

A successful response returns a page object:

Response

```json
{
  "object": "page",
  "id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890",
  "created_time": "2025-01-15T09:30:00.000Z",
  "last_edited_time": "2025-01-15T09:30:00.000Z",
  "icon": {
    "type": "emoji",
    "emoji": "🚀"
  },
  "parent": {
    "type": "workspace",
    "workspace": true
  },
  "properties": {
    "title": {
      "id": "title",
      "type": "title",
      "title": [{ "plain_text": "Hello from the API" }]
    }
  },
  "url": "https://www.notion.so/Hello-from-the-API-a1b2c3d4e5f67890abcdef1234567890",
  "public_url": null
}
```

To see your new page:

- **From the response:** Copy the `url` value and open it in your browser.
- **From Notion:** Look in **Private** in your sidebar for 🚀 **Hello from the API**.

Open the page and you should see your heading, paragraph, and bullet list inside.

Error responses return a JSON object with a `code` and `message`:

```json
{
  "object": "error",
  "status": 401,
  "code": "unauthorized",
  "message": "API token is invalid."
}
```

| Error | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| `unauthorized` | Double-check that your token is correct and hasn’t expired. |
| `validation_error` | Check the request body against the [Create a page](https://developers.notion.com/reference/post-page) reference. |

For the full list of error codes, see [Status codes](https://developers.notion.com/reference/status-codes).
